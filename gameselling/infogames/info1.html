        <h2>FIFA21</h2>

        <p>FIFA 21 is a football simulation video game published by Electronic Arts as part of the FIFA series. It is the 28th installment in the FIFA series, and was released 9 October 2020 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</p>
        <p>%73 Metacritic</p>

        <p> In what’s become a disappointing theme for sports games in general this year, takes small steps in improving its core on-the-pitch play, but largely underwhelms off of it, providing very few big changes this time around. Sure, the moment-to-moment action feels as smooth as it has done in recent years, but a lack of real investment in Career mode and only slight changes to its other main modes feel like a series of missed opportunities. Incidentally, that’s something FIFA 21’s goalkeepers know a lot about when attempting to make a save in this game.</p>

            The world’s best shot stoppers seemingly suffer from fever dreams where their hands melt in front of their eyes when a ball enters their vicinity.

            One contributing factor towards this may be that while the attacking AI may have improved positionally, the same can’t be said as much for defenders. While they seem to come to life around the edge of the box when a shot comes in (I’ve seen a noticeable increase in the amount of players realistically flinging their bodies towards to shots in order to block) they seem over reliant on the player moving each into position, which can be unforgiving at times. I enjoy defending, but I’m not sure FIFA 21 is a game made for players like me, with clean sheets coming at a premium.

            That’s not to say I haven’t been enjoying it; the new collision system makes for more robust challenges and slide tackles actually result in you gaining possession regularly, rather than the ball ricocheting off to far reaches of the pitch. Making a bold defensive move offers a high risk factor, perhaps as it should, but I just wish I had a little more assistance from the players I can’t control at times. For example, if I want to bring a defender out to close down an attacker I’d like my centre-back partner to come round and cover if he manages to beat me one on one. This rarely happens though and forwards get clean in on goal all too easily.

            Autoplay setting: On
            One area that has seen nothing but improvement, though, is crossing – and heading in particular. Gone are the headed shots of FIFA 20 that darted into the stands off of players’ seemingly cubic foreheads. Whipping in a ball from out wide onto a forward now feels like a genuine goal-scoring tactic rather than the low-odds lottery it has done in previous seasons. It’s enjoyable to create a variety of goal-scoring opportunities over the course of a match and not just slipping through-balls to pacey attackers constantly, even if the goalkeeper will ultimately have no answers to any of these questions posed at him.

            Volta, Career and FUT
            Tweaks have also been made off the pitch with changes to FIFA’s many modes. There’s no huge additions this year like the introduction of Volta in FIFA 20, but there have been adjustments to each that add a little extra punch. Volta, for example, comes with The Debut, a short two to three-hour single-player mode that serves as a re-introduction to the street side of football. To call it a story mode would be glorifying it a bit as it offers very little in terms of engaging story, but serves as a way to display the five new arena locations.
